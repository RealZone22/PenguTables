## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out directly to `lenny@petschl.org`.

We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two for us to sync internally and
determine the severity of the report and its impact. Please, _do not_ use a public facing channel or GitHub issues to
report sensitive security issues.

As part of our process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually
two to four weeks after a releasing a version that addresses it.
